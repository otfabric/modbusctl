# Scan algorithms (in-depth)

This document specifies the Modbus register scan algorithms supported by modbusctl. It is written so that each algorithm can be re-implemented outside this codebase without reading the source. All algorithms share the same **executor** and **strategy interface**; only the policy for choosing the next read and reacting to results differs.

---

## 1. Executor and strategy interface

### 1.1 Input configuration and range

Every algorithm receives a scan configuration with at least:

| Parameter    | Type   | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `StartAddress` | uint16 | First register address to consider (inclusive). |
| `EndAddress`   | uint16 | Last register address to consider (inclusive). |
| `Function`     | uint8  | Modbus function code (e.g. 3 = holding, 4 = input). |
| `Delay`        | uint16 | Optional delay in ms between requests. |

Additional parameters (e.g. `Step` for stepped) are described per algorithm.

**Empty range:** If **StartAddress > EndAddress**, the strategy is immediately done and emits no tasks. Implementations must treat this as a valid configuration and return no task from the first Next() (or from Init ensure Done() is true).

### 1.2 Types

- **ScanTask**: `{ Start: uint16, Count: uint16 }` — a single read request. Every task must satisfy **1 ≤ Count ≤ 125** (Modbus limit). No task with Count 0 is valid.
- **ScanResult**: `{ Success, Start, Count, Data, RequestTimestamp, ResponseTimestamp, Err, OutcomeType, ExceptionCode, RTTNanos }` — outcome of executing a ScanTask. **Invariant:** **Success == true** if and only if **OutcomeType == success** (a normal Modbus read response). All other OutcomeTypes (exception, timeout, transport_error, protocol_error, unknown) imply Success == false. **OutcomeType** classifies the result; when `OutcomeType == exception`, **ExceptionCode** is the Modbus exception code (e.g. 0x02 Illegal Data Address). **RTTNanos** is response timestamp minus request timestamp. Strategies can branch on OutcomeType (e.g. do not retry on exception; retry on timeout).
- **Interval**: `{ Start: uint16, Count: uint16 }` — a contiguous range (used internally by some strategies).

### 1.3 Strategy interface

A scan strategy implements:

- **Init(cfg)** — Initialize state from the scan config (e.g. set current position, seed queues).
- **Next() → (ScanTask, bool)** — Return the next task to execute, or `(_, false)` when there is none.
- **OnResult(task, result)** — Update internal state given the result of executing `task`.
- **Done() → bool** — Return true when the strategy has no more work.

The **executor** loop is:

```
connect to device
open output file, write header
strategy.Init(settings)   // scan flags/algo; debug lines go to progress when --debug
while !strategy.Done():
    task, ok := strategy.Next()
    if !ok: break
    result := executeRead(task)   // perform Modbus read, record timestamps
    strategy.OnResult(task, result)
    if result.Success:
        append result to output file
        optionally print block info
    sleep(cfg.Delay)
print summary stats
```

Only **successful** reads are written to the capture file. The strategy decides *what* to read next; the executor handles connection, timing, and I/O.

### 1.4 Modbus constraints

- Valid register addresses: **0–65535**.
- Maximum read size per request: **125** registers (Modbus limit). All algorithms cap any single read at 125.
- A read of `count` registers starting at `start` covers addresses `[start, start+count-1]` inclusive. A read may **fail** because the range is unsupported (e.g. Modbus exception) or because of timeout, transport, or protocol errors; strategies may interpret these differently using **OutcomeType**.

---

## 2. Algorithm: **safe**

**Goal:** Conservative, predictable scan. Linear pass over the range; at each position try the largest allowed block first, then smaller sizes until one succeeds or all fail. No refinement, no retry storms.

### 2.1 Parameters

- Uses only the common config: `StartAddress`, `EndAddress`, `Function`, `Delay`.

### 2.2 Constants

- **Candidate sizes** (in order, descending): `[125, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`.
- **MaxBlockSize** = 125.

### 2.3 State

- `current` — next address to try (initially `StartAddress`).
- `end` — `EndAddress`.
- `candidates` — list of sizes that fit in `[current, end]` from the candidate list (only sizes ≤ `end - current + 1`).
- `candidateIndex` — index into `candidates` for the next size to try (0 when starting at a new address).
- `done` — set when `current > end`.
- **`leftBoundaryProbePending`** (bool) — true when a one-off left-boundary probe has been scheduled and must be returned by Next() before completion.
- **`leftBoundaryProbeAddr`** (uint16) — when `leftBoundaryProbePending` is true, the address to probe (task is `(leftBoundaryProbeAddr, 1)`).
- **`hadFailureThisAddr`** (bool) — true if we have seen at least one failure at the current `current` address in this ladder.

### 2.4 Init

- `current = StartAddress`
- `end = EndAddress`
- `done = false`
- `candidates = nil`, `candidateIndex = 0`
- `leftBoundaryProbePending = false`, `hadFailureThisAddr = false`

### 2.5 Next()

1. **If `leftBoundaryProbePending`**: return task `{ Start: leftBoundaryProbeAddr, Count: 1 }` and set `leftBoundaryProbePending = false`. Do not advance `current`.
2. If `done` or `current > end`: return no task.
3. If `candidates` is nil or `candidateIndex >= len(candidates)`:
   - Build `candidates`: from `[125, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]` take every size ≤ `end - current + 1`.
   - Set `candidateIndex = 0`.
   - If `candidates` is empty, set `done = true` and return no task.
4. `count = candidates[candidateIndex]`, increment `candidateIndex`.
5. Return task `{ Start: current, Count: count }`.

### 2.6 OnResult(task, result)

- If **success**:
  - If we had at least one failure at this address (`hadFailureThisAddr`) and `task.Start > 0`, schedule one **left-boundary probe**: set `leftBoundaryProbeAddr = task.Start − 1`, `leftBoundaryProbePending = true`. The probe is a **one-off refinement**: its result is recorded normally by the executor, but it **does not alter** `current` and **does not restart** candidate scanning at that address.
  - Then `current += task.Count`; set `candidates = nil`, `candidateIndex = 0`, `hadFailureThisAddr = false`.
- If **failure**: set `hadFailureThisAddr = true`; if `candidateIndex >= len(candidates)` (all sizes tried at this address), set `current += 1`, `candidates = nil`, `candidateIndex = 0`.

### 2.7 Done()

- Return true **only when** `current > end` **and** `!leftBoundaryProbePending`. (The pending boundary probe must be returned and processed before the strategy is done.)

### 2.8 Worst-case (no successful reads)

- At each address we try at most 8 sizes. So: **rangeLen × 8** reads, where `rangeLen = EndAddress - StartAddress + 1`.

### 2.9 Example (reduced range)

- Config: start=0, end=10.
- Try (0, 10) — fail (10 < 125, so count 10 is used from candidates). Then (0, 8), (0, 4), (0, 2), (0, 1). Suppose (0, 1) succeeds. Because we had a failure at this address and task.Start=0, no left-boundary probe is scheduled (task.Start > 0 required). Advance: current=1.
- If instead (1, 8) failed and (1, 4) succeeded: we had failure at this address and task.Start=1 > 0, so schedule left-boundary probe (0, 1). Then current += 4 → current=5. Next() returns (0, 1) first; after OnResult for (0, 1), current remains 5 (the boundary probe does not alter current). Then normal ladder continues from current=5.

---

## 3. Algorithm: **smart**

**Goal:** Discover readable regions efficiently with divide-and-conquer. Start with large (125-register) chunks; only split a chunk when a read fails, and only down to single-register granularity. Avoids sliding one address at a time when large regions fail. **Note:** The priority queue (smaller intervals first) makes smart more refinement-oriented than a pure coarse-first traversal; boundaries are discovered sooner.

### 3.1 Parameters

- Uses only the common config: `StartAddress`, `EndAddress`, `Function`, `Delay`.

### 3.2 Constants

- **MaxBlockSize** = 125.

### 3.3 State

- `queue` — **Priority queue** (min-heap) of **Interval** `{ Start, Count }`. **Ordering:** primary key = smaller `Count`; **secondary key** (tie-break) = smaller `Start`. This makes processing order deterministic: smaller intervals are preferred to discover boundaries sooner; ties are broken by Start.
- `visited` — set (or map) of intervals already issued, keyed e.g. by `(Start << 16) | Count` to avoid duplicates.

### 3.4 Init

- Clear `queue` and `visited`.
- Build initial intervals over `[StartAddress, EndAddress]` in 125-sized chunks (last chunk may be smaller):
  - `s = StartAddress`
  - While `s <= EndAddress`: `count = min(125, EndAddress - s + 1)`; push `{ Start: s, Count: count }` onto the heap; `s += count`.

### 3.5 Next()

1. While `queue` is not empty:
   - Pop the interval `iv` with smallest `Count` from the heap (ties broken by smaller `Start`).
   - Compute key = e.g. `(iv.Start << 16) | iv.Count`. If key is in `visited`, skip (pop next).
   - Mark key as visited.
   - Return task `{ Start: iv.Start, Count: iv.Count }`.
2. Return no task.

### 3.6 OnResult(task, result)

- If **success**: do nothing (executor records the block).
- If **failure**:
  - If `task.Count > 1`: split into two intervals:
    - `leftCount = task.Count / 2`
    - `rightStart = task.Start + leftCount`
    - `rightCount = task.Count - leftCount`
    - Push `{ Start: task.Start, Count: leftCount }` and `{ Start: rightStart, Count: rightCount }` onto the heap.
  - If `task.Count == 1`: do nothing (address marked unreadable).

### 3.7 Done()

- Return `len(queue) == 0`.

### 3.8 Worst-case (no successful reads)

- Initial chunks: `ceil(rangeLen / 125)`. Each failed chunk of size > 1 produces two new chunks. Upper bound used in implementation: **2×rangeLen − initialChunks** reads.

### 3.9 Example

- Config: start=0, end=249. Initial queue: two chunks — [0,125] and [125,124] (since 125+124=249). No third chunk at 250 because 250 > 249.
- After the initial failures, the heap contains four smaller intervals; **subsequent processing order is by heap order** (smallest Count first, then smallest Start on ties), not insertion order. So the next popped tasks might be [0,62], [125,62], [62,63], [187,62] depending on Count then Start. Continue until all chunks are size 1 and processed.

---

## 4. Algorithm: **deep**

**Goal:** Same as smart for phase 1; then a second phase that refines around the **boundaries** of every successfully read interval with small probes, to find exact edges and small islands. Capped to avoid excessive traffic.

### 4.1 Parameters

- Uses only the common config: `StartAddress`, `EndAddress`, `Function`, `Delay`.

### 4.2 Constants

- **MaxBlockSize** = 125.
- **deepRefinementWindow** = 8 (registers to each side of a boundary; evidence-driven only at boundaries).
- **deepRefinementCap** = 500 (max refinement tasks).
- **deepRefinementCounts** = [1, 2, 4, 8].

### 4.3 State

- `phase` — 1 (smart) or 2 (refinement).
- `smart` — full **smart** strategy instance (same state as in section 3).
- `readableIntervals` — list of intervals that were successfully read in phase 1.
- `failedIntervals` — list of intervals that failed in phase 1 (for boundary evidence).
- `refinementQueue` — list of ScanTasks for phase 2.
- `refinementSeen` — set of (Start, Count) already in queue, to deduplicate.

### 4.4 Init

- Set `phase = 1`.
- Create and init **smart** strategy with the same config.
- `readableIntervals = []`, `failedIntervals = []`, `refinementQueue = []`, `refinementSeen = {}`.

### 4.5 Next()

1. If `phase == 1`: (task, ok) := smart.Next(). If ok, return (task, true). If !ok, set phase = 2, call **buildRefinementQueue** (below), then fall through to step 2 (do not return no task until phase 2 has been checked).
2. If `phase == 2`: if `refinementQueue` is not empty, pop the first task and return it; else return no task.

### 4.6 buildRefinementQueue() (evidence-driven)

- Refine **only where there is evidence of a boundary**: a readable interval edge that has **failed-neighbor evidence**. Define evidence as: **a failed interval whose covered address range intersects the window [edge − 1, edge + 1]** (or the same idea: any failed interval that overlaps the one-register window around the edge). For each interval `iv` in `readableIntervals` (until refinement queue size ≥ deepRefinementCap):
  - `intervalStart = iv.Start`, `intervalEnd = iv.Start + iv.Count - 1`.
  - **Left boundary**: only if `intervalStart > StartAddress` and there exists a failed interval whose range intersects `[intervalStart − 1, intervalStart + 1]`. Then for start in `[intervalStart − 8, intervalStart + 8]` clamped to config, for each count in [1,2,4,8] such that the read stays in range, if (start, count) not in `refinementSeen`, add task and mark.
  - **Right boundary**: only if `intervalEnd < EndAddress` and there exists a failed interval whose range intersects `[intervalEnd − 1, intervalEnd + 1]`. Same ±8 window and counts.
- If no failed intervals were recorded, no refinement tasks are added (no evidence).

### 4.7 OnResult(task, result)

- If `phase == 1`: call `smart.OnResult(task, result)`. If `result.Success`, append `{ Start: task.Start, Count: task.Count }` to `readableIntervals`. If **failure**, append to `failedIntervals`.
- If `phase == 2`: do nothing (executor already records success).

### 4.8 Done()

- If `phase == 1`: return **false**. (Completion of phase 1 is detected inside Next() when smart.Next() returns no task; then phase is set to 2. Therefore Done() deliberately remains false until phase 2 has been evaluated.)
- If `phase == 2`: return `len(refinementQueue) == 0`.

### 4.9 Worst-case

- Phase 1: same as smart, e.g. **2×rangeLen − initialChunks**.
- Phase 2: up to **500** refinement reads.
- Total: **phase1 + 500**.

### 4.10 Example

- Phase 1 finds readable [100, 224] (125 regs) and [300, 324] (25 regs). Phase 2 adds probes only where a failed interval is adjacent (evidence-driven). For [100, 224]: left boundary window 92–108 (±8 around 100), right boundary window 216–232 (±8 around 224). For [300, 324]: left 292–308, right 316–332. Counts used: [1, 2, 4, 8] only.

## 5. Algorithm: **stepped**

**Goal:** Quick pass over a large range by probing only at **step** positions (e.g. 0, 1000, 2000, …). At each step, run a small set of probes; if any succeed, “expand” from that address with larger blocks to get maximum coverage at that hotspot, then move to the next step.

### 5.1 Parameters

- **Step** (uint16) — distance between step positions (default 1000). **Must be ≥ 1** when algo is stepped; if Step == 0, **treat strategy as done immediately** (emit no tasks). This keeps the algorithm spec self-contained.
- **StepHalfOffset** (bool) — when true, also add step positions at `start+step/2`, `start+step+step/2`, … (so probes run at 0, 50, 100, 150, … for step=100). Positions are deduplicated and sorted.
- Plus common config: `StartAddress`, `EndAddress`, `Function`, `Delay`.

### 5.2 Constants

- **Probe counts** at each step: 1 and 2 registers.
- **Probe positions** at step `pos`: `pos-1`, `pos`, `pos+1` (clamped so that the read stays within [0, 65535]; probe addresses may extend to StartAddress−1 and EndAddress+1 for boundary detection only).
- **steppedExpandSizes** = [125, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4] — sizes to try for expansion from a hit address. **Expansion reads are strictly clamped** to [StartAddress, EndAddress]: a read from hitAddr with size must satisfy hitAddr + size − 1 ≤ EndAddress (no expansion past the configured end).

### 5.3 State

- `stepPositions` — list of step positions (addresses) in order.
- `stepIndex` — current step (0-based).
- `probeTasks` — list of ScanTasks for the current step (up to 6: 3 positions × 2 counts).
- `probeIndex` — index into `probeTasks`.
- **`hasHit`** — true when any probe at the current step succeeded (use this, not `hitAddr == 0`, because **address 0 is valid** in Modbus; a hit at 0 would set hitAddr=0 and must still trigger expansion).
- `hitAddr` — address where a probe succeeded (meaningful when hasHit is true).
- `expandIndex` — 0..len(steppedExpandSizes)-1 when expanding from hitAddr, or -1 when not expanding.

### 5.4 Init

- If **Step == 0**, treat the strategy as done immediately: set `stepPositions = []` (or equivalent) and return; do not build positions. No tasks will be emitted.
- Build **primary** step positions: for `pos = StartAddress`; while `pos <= EndAddress`, append `pos`, then `pos += Step` (stop if overflow or past end).
- If **StepHalfOffset** is true: also build positions at `start + Step/2 + k×Step` for k = 0, 1, … (i.e. `StartAddress + Step/2`, `StartAddress + Step/2 + Step`, …). For odd Step, **Step/2** uses integer division (e.g. Step=1000 → half at 500).
- Discard any position outside [StartAddress, EndAddress] (or keep only those that fit the configured range for step alignment).
- **Deduplicate** the combined list and **sort ascending**.
- `stepIndex = 0`, `probeIndex = 0`, `hasHit = false`, `hitAddr = 0`, `expandIndex = -1`.
- Call **buildProbeTasks** for the current step.

### 5.5 buildProbeTasks()

- Clear `probeTasks` and set `probeIndex = 0`.
- If `stepIndex >= len(stepPositions)`, return.
- `pos = stepPositions[stepIndex]`.
- Define minAddr/maxAddr: e.g. if StartAddress > 0 then minAddr = StartAddress−1 else 0; if EndAddress < 65535 then maxAddr = EndAddress+1 else 65535 (clamp to 65535).
- For each of `pos-1`, `pos`, `pos+1` (clamped to [minAddr, maxAddr], and only if within 0..65535), for each count in {1, 2}: if read [addr, addr+count-1] would not exceed maxAddr, append `{ Start: addr, Count: count }` to `probeTasks`.

### 5.6 Next()

1. If `stepIndex >= len(stepPositions)`: return no task.
2. **Expansion**: if `expandIndex >= 0` and `expandIndex < len(steppedExpandSizes)`:
   - Let `maxEnd` = **EndAddress** (expansion is strictly within configured range; no read may end past EndAddress).
   - For each size in steppedExpandSizes from expandIndex: if `hitAddr + size - 1 <= maxEnd`, return task `{ Start: hitAddr, Count: size }` (OnResult will increment expandIndex).
   - If no size fits, clear hitAddr and expandIndex, advance stepIndex, rebuild probe tasks, recurse Next().
3. If there is a task in `probeTasks` at `probeIndex`: return it and increment `probeIndex`.
4. If **hasHit**: set `expandIndex = 0`, return task `{ Start: hitAddr, Count: steppedExpandSizes[0] }` (if it fits within maxEnd).
5. Advance `stepIndex`; if past end return no task. Set `hasHit = false`, `hitAddr = 0`, buildProbeTasks for new step, recurse Next().

### 5.7 OnResult(task, result)

- If we are in expansion (expandIndex >= 0):
  - If **success**: clear `hasHit` and hitAddr, set expandIndex = -1, advance stepIndex, buildProbeTasks, done with this step.
  - If **failure**: increment expandIndex; if expandIndex >= len(steppedExpandSizes), clear hasHit and hitAddr and expandIndex, advance stepIndex, buildProbeTasks.
- If we are in probe phase: if **success** and **not hasHit**, set `hasHit = true`, `hitAddr = task.Start`.

### 5.8 Done()

- True when stepIndex >= len(stepPositions) and not in the middle of expansion or probes or a pending hit (i.e. **hasHit** is false when all probes at current step are consumed).

### 5.9 Worst-case (no successful reads)

- **Exact:** **6 × len(stepPositions)** reads (each step position gets up to 6 probes; no expansion if no hit). This is correct for both StepHalfOffset = false and true, since len(stepPositions) already reflects half-offset and deduplication.
- When **StepHalfOffset = false**: len(stepPositions) = ceil((EndAddress − StartAddress + 1) / Step) for non-empty range (or 0 if range empty). So worst-case = 6 × ceil(rangeLen / Step).
- When **StepHalfOffset = true**: len(stepPositions) is larger (roughly up to twice the base count, minus deduplication); use the actual length for the formula.

### 5.10 Example

- start=0, end=1999, step=1000. Step positions: [0, 1000].
- At step 0: run the six probes (e.g. (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)). **If all six probes fail**, then stepIndex=1 and we move to the next step. **If any probe succeeds**, set hasHit=true, hitAddr=that task’s Start; then expansion from that hit address (reads strictly within [0, 1999]). At step 1000: again 6 probes; all fail → done. Total 12 reads if no hits.

**Range note:** Only the **micro-probes** (pos±1, count 1 or 2) may use addresses slightly outside [StartAddress, EndAddress] for boundary detection. **Expansion** reads are strictly clamped to [StartAddress, EndAddress].

## 6. Algorithm: **linear**

**Goal:** Find maximum contiguous readable blocks aligned to 125-register boundaries. Probe 125-sized blocks; when one succeeds, extend forward with more 125s; when the next 125 fails, binary-search for the maximum tail (1..125). When a 125 succeeds *after* a previous 125 failed, binary-search backwards to find the real start of the readable region, then continue forward and tail as above.

### 6.1 Parameters

- Uses only the common config: `StartAddress`, `EndAddress`, `Function`, `Delay`.

### 6.2 Phases

- **Probe** — try 125-block at current position; on success go to Forward or Backward; on failure advance by 125.
- **Backward** — (only if previous 125 failed) binary-search for maximum backward extent from the successful 125 start; then go to Forward.
- **Forward** — repeatedly try next 125 at blockEnd; on success extend blockEnd; on failure go to Tail.
- **Tail** — binary-search for maximum count readable at blockEnd; then go back to Probe.

### 6.3 State

- `start`, `end` — from config.
- `phase` — Probe | Backward | Forward | Tail.
- `probeStart` — next 125-aligned position to try in Probe (e.g. start, start+125, …).
- `hadProbeFailure` — true if the previous probe (125) failed (used to decide Backward vs Forward).
- `originalBlockStart` — start address of the 125-block that succeeded after a failure (for Backward).
- `blockStart`, `blockEnd` — current contiguous readable region [blockStart, blockEnd) (blockEnd exclusive).
- Backward binary search: `backwardLow`, `backwardHigh`, `backwardBest` (search for max K such that read(originalBlockStart−K, K) succeeds).
- Tail binary search: `tailLow`, `tailHigh`, `tailBest` (search for max count C such that read(blockEnd, C) succeeds). After tail search, the **confirmed readable region** is [blockStart, blockEnd + tailBest) (blockEnd is not updated during tail; tailBest is the largest successful count at blockEnd).
- `done` — set when probeStart > end and we exit Probe.
- **`hasGapProbe`** (bool) — true when a gap probe is pending (do not use address as sentinel: **address 0 is valid**). **`gapProbeAddr`** (uint16) — when hasGapProbe is true, the address to probe (task is (gapProbeAddr, 1)).
- **`lastTaskWasGapProbe`** (bool) — true when the last task returned by Next() was the gap probe; OnResult must then **not** update probe/forward/backward/tail state (the gap probe is observation-only for the strategy; the executor still records success to MCAP).

### 6.4 Init

- `phase = Probe`, `probeStart = StartAddress`, `hadProbeFailure = false`, `done = false`, `hasGapProbe = false`, `lastTaskWasGapProbe = false`.
- Clear block/backward/tail fields (blockStart=0, blockEnd=0, backwardLow/High/Best=0, tailLow/High/Best=0).

### 6.5 Next() — Probe

- If **hasGapProbe** is true: set `lastTaskWasGapProbe = true`, clear hasGapProbe, return `(gapProbeAddr, 1)`. This detects small readable islands in the gap between the last block and the next 125-block.
- If `probeStart > end`: set `done = true`, return no task.
- `count = min(125, end - probeStart + 1)`.
- Return `{ Start: probeStart, Count: count }`.

### 6.6 Next() — Backward

- If `backwardLow > backwardHigh`: set `blockStart = originalBlockStart - backwardBest`, `blockEnd = originalBlockStart + 125`, `phase = Forward`, then return Next() (which will issue the first forward read).
- `mid = (backwardLow + backwardHigh) / 2`.
- `chunkStart = originalBlockStart - mid`. If `chunkStart < start`, set `backwardHigh = mid - 1` and recurse Next().
- Return `{ Start: chunkStart, Count: mid }`.

### 6.7 Next() — Forward

- If `blockEnd > end`: set `probeStart = blockEnd`, `phase = Probe`, `hadProbeFailure = false`, return Next().
- Return `{ Start: blockEnd, Count: min(125, end - blockEnd + 1) }`.

### 6.8 Next() — Tail

- If `tailLow > tailHigh`: the confirmed readable region for this block is [blockStart, blockEnd + tailBest). Set `probeStart = blockEnd + tailBest` (or `blockEnd + 125` if tailBest==0). If `probeStart > blockEnd + 1`, set **gap probe** pending: `gapProbeAddr = blockEnd`, `hasGapProbe = true`. Then `phase = Probe`, `hadProbeFailure = false`, return Next().
- `mid = (tailLow + tailHigh) / 2`. If mid < 1 or mid > (end - blockEnd + 1), adjust range and recurse.
- Return `{ Start: blockEnd, Count: mid }`.

### 6.9 OnResult — Probe

- If **lastTaskWasGapProbe** is true: clear lastTaskWasGapProbe and return (no state change; the gap probe result is recorded by the executor only). **Example:** After a block [100,225) and tailBest=0, probeStart=350; a gap probe (225,1) is emitted. If it succeeds, the executor writes that one register to MCAP, but the strategy does not update blockStart, blockEnd, or phase — the next Next() returns the normal 125-block at 350.
- If **success**:
  - If `hadProbeFailure`: set `phase = Backward`, `originalBlockStart = probeStart`, `blockEnd = probeStart + task.Count`. Set `backwardLow = 1`, `backwardHigh = min(125, originalBlockStart - start)`, `backwardBest = 0`.
  - Else: set `phase = Forward`, `blockStart = probeStart`, `blockEnd = probeStart + task.Count`.
- If **failure**: set `hadProbeFailure = true`, `probeStart += 125`.

### 6.10 OnResult — Backward

- `mid = task.Count`.
- If **success**: `backwardBest = mid`, `backwardLow = mid + 1`.
- If **failure**: `backwardHigh = mid - 1` (or 0 if mid was 1).

### 6.11 OnResult — Forward

- If **success**: `blockEnd += task.Count`.
- If **failure**: set `phase = Tail`, `tailLow = 1`, `tailHigh = min(125, end - blockEnd + 1)`, `tailBest = 0`.

### 6.12 OnResult — Tail

- `mid = task.Count`.
- If **success**: `tailBest = mid`, `tailLow = mid + 1`.
- If **failure**: `tailHigh = mid - 1` (or 0 if mid was 1).

### 6.13 Done()

- Return `done`.

### 6.14 Worst-case (no successful reads)

- One read per 125-aligned block: **ceil((end − start + 1) / 125)** (or 1 if range non-empty but smaller than 125).

### 6.15 Example

- start=0, end=400. Probe (0,125) fail, (125,125) fail, (250,125) success. hadProbeFailure=true → Backward. originalBlockStart=250, blockEnd=375. backwardLow=1, backwardHigh=min(125,250)=125. Mid=63, try (187,63); success → backwardBest=63, backwardLow=64. Mid=95, try (155,95); fail → backwardHigh=94. … Eventually blockStart=250−best, blockEnd=375, phase=Forward. Try (375,125); fail → Tail. Binary search for max count at 375 in [1, 25] (since end=400). Then probeStart = 375+tailBest or 500, phase=Probe, continue.
- **Gap-probe path:** Suppose block [100,225), tail search yields tailBest=10 (so only 10 registers readable at blockEnd=225). Then probeStart = 225+10 = 235. Since 235 > 225+1, a **gap probe** is pending at 225. Next() returns (225,1); the executor runs it and, if successful, writes that one register to MCAP. OnResult(Probe) sees lastTaskWasGapProbe and returns without changing state. Next() then returns the normal 125-block at 235.

## 7. Algorithm: **boundary**

**Goal:** Given one known successful read (seed), find the **maximal readable interval** containing it with minimal reads. Use after stepped or smart finds a hotspot, or when you have a known-good (start, count) from a prior run.

### 7.1 Parameters

- **SeedStart** (uint16) — start address of the known-good read.
- **SeedCount** (uint16) — register count of the seed (1–125). Required when algo is boundary.
- Plus common config: `StartAddress`, `EndAddress`, `Function`, `Delay` (expansion is clamped to this range).

### 7.2 Phases

- **Seed** — emit the seed task once; on success continue to left expand, on failure set phase = Done.
- **Left expand** — attempted only while **blockStart > StartAddress**. Exponentially try (blockStart − 1, 1), (blockStart − 2, 2), (blockStart − 4, 4), … up to 125. On success, blockStart moves left; on failure, switch to **left binary** with leftLow = task.Start, leftHigh = blockStart. **Clamping (one rule):** if `blockStart - size < StartAddress`, **clamp** the read: issue `(StartAddress, blockStart - StartAddress)` only if that count is **≥ 1**. If clamping would yield Count == 0 (e.g. blockStart == StartAddress), **left expand is complete**; set **leftLow = StartAddress, leftHigh = blockStart**, then transition to **LeftBinary** without emitting a task. **Never emit a task with Count == 0.**
- **Left binary** — binary search for the leftmost readable address; then go to **right expand**. **Invariants:** On entering LeftBinary, `leftHigh` is known readable and `leftLow` is a known non-readable or lower search bound; the true left boundary lies in [leftLow, leftHigh]. **When left expand completed without a failure** (e.g. seed at StartAddress), bounds are leftLow = StartAddress, leftHigh = blockStart; if leftLow ≥ leftHigh, there is no search space — do not emit a task; set phase = RightExpand immediately. Otherwise termination occurs when no address remains between them (leftLow ≥ leftHigh).
- **Right expand** — try (blockEnd, 1), (blockEnd, 2), … up to 125. On success, blockEnd extends right; on failure, switch to **right binary** with rightLow = blockEnd, rightHigh = min(blockEnd+125−1, end, 65535). **Clamping (one rule):** if `blockEnd + size - 1 > EndAddress` or would exceed 65535, **clamp** the read: issue `(blockEnd, EndAddress - blockEnd + 1)` only if that count is **≥ 1**. If clamping would yield Count == 0, **right expand is complete**; set **rightLow = blockEnd**, **rightHigh** = min(blockEnd+125−1, end, 65535), then transition to **RightBinary** without emitting a task. **Never emit a task with Count == 0.**
- **Right binary** — binary search for the rightmost readable address; then **done**. **Invariants:** On entering RightBinary, `rightLow` is the first candidate beyond the currently confirmed readable region and `rightHigh` is the greatest address still possibly readable. **When right expand completed without a failure** (e.g. blockEnd already at EndAddress), if rightLow > rightHigh there is no search space — do not emit a task; set phase = Done immediately. Otherwise termination occurs when rightLow > rightHigh.

### 7.3 State

- `blockStart`, `blockEnd` — current known readable interval [blockStart, blockEnd) (exclusive end). Initially from seed.
- `phase` — Seed | LeftExpand | LeftBinary | RightExpand | RightBinary | Done.
- `seedEmitted` — true after the seed task has been returned.
- Left expand: `leftExpandIdx` into sizes [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,125]. Left binary: `leftLow`, `leftHigh` (invariants above).
- Right expand: `rightExpandIdx`. Right binary: `rightLow`, `rightHigh` (invariants above).

### 7.4 Init

- `blockStart = SeedStart`, `blockEnd = SeedStart + SeedCount`, `start = StartAddress`, `end = EndAddress`.
- `phase = Seed`, `seedEmitted = false`.
- **Seed validation:** The **entire seed read** must lie inside the configured range [StartAddress, EndAddress]. If **SeedStart < StartAddress**, or **SeedStart + SeedCount − 1 > EndAddress**, or SeedCount is invalid (0 or >125), set `phase = Done` immediately (strategy emits no tasks). Reject or treat as done so that the seed task itself is never issued out-of-range.

### 7.5 Next() / OnResult

- **Seed**: Next returns (SeedStart, SeedCount) once; OnResult success → phase = LeftExpand; failure → phase = Done.
- **Left expand**: only while blockStart > StartAddress. For next size in list: if blockStart − size < StartAddress, clamp to (StartAddress, blockStart − StartAddress) only if that count ≥ 1; if count would be 0, left expand complete → set leftLow = StartAddress, leftHigh = blockStart, phase = LeftBinary (no task). Else return (blockStart − size, size) or clamped task. Success → blockStart = task.Start. Failure → phase = LeftBinary, leftLow = task.Start, leftHigh = blockStart.
- **Left binary**: if leftLow ≥ leftHigh (no search space), phase = RightExpand, no task. Else mid = (leftLow+leftHigh)/2, count = blockStart−mid; return (mid, count). Success → blockStart = task.Start, leftHigh = task.Start. Failure → leftLow = task.Start+task.Count. When leftLow ≥ leftHigh, phase = RightExpand.
- **Right expand**: for next size: if read would exceed EndAddress, clamp to (blockEnd, EndAddress − blockEnd + 1) only if that count ≥ 1; if count would be 0, right expand complete → set rightLow = blockEnd, rightHigh = min(blockEnd+125−1, end, 65535), phase = RightBinary (no task). Else return (blockEnd, size) or clamped task. Success → blockEnd = task.Start+task.Count. Failure → phase = RightBinary, rightLow = blockEnd, rightHigh = min(blockEnd+125−1, end, 65535).
- **Right binary**: if rightLow > rightHigh (no search space), phase = Done, no task. Else mid = (rightLow+rightHigh)/2 (use uint32 to avoid overflow), count = mid−blockEnd+1; return (blockEnd, count). Success → blockEnd = task.Start+task.Count, rightLow = task.Start+task.Count. Failure → rightHigh = mid−1 (or task.Start+task.Count−2). When rightLow > rightHigh, phase = Done.

**Binary semantics:** Re-implementations should verify invariants and off-by-one behaviour for: one-register extension (count 1 at boundary), full failure immediately next to seed, and seed touching StartAddress or EndAddress.

### 7.6 Done()

- Return true when phase == Done.

### 7.7 Worst-case

- 1 seed + left expand (up to 8 sizes) + left binary (O(log range)) + right expand (8) + right binary (O(log range)). Depends on range; no fixed formula.

## 8. Algorithm: sunspec

SunSpec protocol-aware scan. Detects the SunSpec base address, then walks the model chain reading each header (2 registers) followed by the full model body (in chunks of up to 125 registers). Does not use `--start`/`--end`.

### 8.1 Phases

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **detectBase** | Probe candidate base addresses for the SunS marker (`0x5375`, `0x6E53`). |
| **walkModels** | Starting at base+2, read 2 registers for the model header (ID + length), then read the full model body (`length` registers in chunks ≤ 125); advance by 2+length to the next header. |
| **done** | Terminal: all bases failed, end model reached, read failure, or limit exceeded. |

### 8.2 Init

1. Parse `SunSpecBases` (comma-separated → `[]uint16`). If empty, use the library default: `[0, 40000, 50000, 1, 39999, 40001, 49999, 50001]`.
2. If `SunSpecBase > 0` (known base): skip detection, set `phase = walkModels`, `currentAddr = base + 2`.
3. Otherwise: `phase = detectBase`, `baseIndex = 0`.
4. `maxModels` = `SunSpecMaxModels` (default 256 when 0). `maxSpan` from config (0 = unlimited).

### 8.3 Next

- **detectBase:** if `baseIndex ≥ len(bases)` → done. Else return `{bases[baseIndex], 2}`.
- **walkModels:** if `readingBody` → return `{bodyAddr, min(125, bodyRemaining)}`. Otherwise: if `modelCount ≥ maxModels` → done. If `maxSpan > 0 && currentAddr − baseAddr > maxSpan` → done. Else return `{currentAddr, 2}` (header read).
- **done:** return `(_, false)`.

### 8.4 OnResult

- **detectBase:**
  - If success and data ≥ 4 bytes: decode `r0, r1` as big-endian uint16. If `r0 == 0x5375 && r1 == 0x6E53` → `baseAddr = task.Start`, `currentAddr = base + 2`, `phase = walkModels`. Return.
  - Otherwise: `baseIndex++`. If `baseIndex ≥ len(bases)` → done.
- **walkModels (body sub-phase):**
  - If failure → done.
  - `bodyAddr += task.Count`, `bodyRemaining -= task.Count`. If `bodyRemaining == 0` → `readingBody = false` (next `Next()` emits the next header read).
- **walkModels (header):**
  - If failure or data < 4 bytes → done.
  - Decode `id, length`. If `id == 0xFFFF && length == 0` → end model, done.
  - If `length == 0` (non-end) → malformed, done.
  - If `currentAddr + 2 + length > 65535` → overflow, done.
  - Otherwise: set `readingBody = true`, `bodyAddr = currentAddr + 2`, `bodyRemaining = length`, `currentAddr += 2 + length`, `modelCount++`.

### 8.5 Done

- Return `phase == done`.

### 8.6 Executor compatibility

The executor works unchanged. Header tasks are `{Start, Count: 2}` (4 bytes); body tasks are `{Start, Count: min(125, remaining)}`. On success the executor records each payload in MCAP — the result is a complete capture of the SunS marker, all model headers, and all model register data. The `--delay` and `--retry-timeout` flags apply between tasks as usual. The scan banner prints `SunSpec discovery with function code N (algo: sunspec)` instead of the generic address range message.

### 8.7 Worst-case

- **B** base probes + **M** × (1 header + ceil(length/125) body chunks), where B = len(bases) and M ≤ maxModels (default 256). For typical SunSpec devices the total is well under 100 reads.

### 8.8 CLI flags

| Flag | Default | Env var | Description |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `--sunspec-base` | 0 | `MODBUSCTL_SUNSPEC_BASE` | Known SunSpec base address; skip detection when set. |
| `--sunspec-bases` | "" | `MODBUSCTL_SUNSPEC_BASES` | Comma-separated candidate base addresses to probe. |
| `--sunspec-max-models` | 0 (→256) | `MODBUSCTL_SUNSPEC_MAX_MODELS` | Maximum model headers to read. |
| `--sunspec-max-span` | 0 | `MODBUSCTL_SUNSPEC_MAX_SPAN` | Maximum address span from base (0 = no limit). |

## 9. Summary table

| Algo     | Goal                                | Worst-case reads (no hits)    |
|----------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| safe     | Linear, try sizes 125..1            | rangeLen × 8                  |
| smart    | Divide-and-conquer 125 chunks       | ≈ 2×rangeLen − initialChunks  |
| deep     | Smart + evidence-driven refinement  | smart + up to 500             |
| stepped  | Step positions × 6 probes           | 6 × len(stepPositions)        |
| linear   | 125-blocks + binary tail/back       | ceil(rangeLen/125)            |
| boundary | Expand from seed + binary boundaries| 1 seed + O(expand + log range)|
| sunspec  | SunSpec marker + model chain (header + body) | B probes + M×(1+ceil(len/125)) |

With `rangeLen = EndAddress − StartAddress + 1`, `initialChunks = ceil(rangeLen/125)`. For **stepped**, worst-case = **6 × len(stepPositions)** (Step ≥ 1; when StepHalfOffset is false, len(stepPositions) = ceil(rangeLen/Step)). For **sunspec**, B = number of candidate base addresses (default 8), M ≤ maxModels (default 256).

## 10. Algorithm selection guidance

- **safe** — Device is fragile; you need predictable behavior; range is small. Conservative fallback.
- **smart** — Best default. Unknown device; medium/large range; best balance of completeness and efficiency.
- **deep** — After smart found interesting regions; you want precise interval edges. Evidence-driven refinement at success/failure boundaries only.
- **stepped** — Range is huge; cheap first pass; triage many devices. Not a final mapper.
- **linear** — Suspect long contiguous maps; PLC-style devices; speed over fragmentation tolerance.
- **boundary** — You have one known-good (start, count); you want the maximal readable interval around it. Use `--seed-start` and `--seed-count`.
- **sunspec** — SunSpec-compliant device (inverters, meters, energy). Protocol-aware detection + model-chain walk; captures headers to MCAP. No `--start`/`--end` needed.

---

## 11. Re-implementation checklist

- Implement the **executor** loop and **strategy** interface (Init, Next, OnResult, Done). If StartAddress > EndAddress, strategy is done immediately.
- **ScanTask**: 1 ≤ Count ≤ 125. **ScanResult**: Success == true iff OutcomeType == success.
- For **safe**: candidate list [125,64,32,16,8,4,2,1], linear current, recompute candidates when advancing; **left-boundary probe** state (leftBoundaryProbePending, leftBoundaryProbeAddr); Next() returns pending probe first; Done() is true only when current > end and no probe pending; probe is one-off (does not alter current).
- For **smart**: **priority queue** (min-heap by Count, tie-break by Start), seed with 125-chunks, split failed intervals in half, dedupe with visited set.
- For **deep**: run smart, collect readable and failed intervals; refinement only where a **failed interval intersects [edge−1, edge+1]**; ±8 window, counts [1,2,4,8], cap at 500; Done() in phase 1 returns false (completion detected in Next()).
- For **stepped**: if Step == 0, strategy done immediately (no tasks). Step positions (with **StepHalfOffset**: add start+Step/2+k×Step, dedupe, sort); 6 probes per step (pos±1, pos × count 1,2); use **hasHit** (not hitAddr==0); expansion **strictly clamped** to [StartAddress, EndAddress]; only micro-probes may extend ±1 at edges.
- For **linear**: four-phase state machine (Probe → Backward if late hit, else Forward → Tail → Probe), binary search for backward extent and tail count; **hasGapProbe** + **gapProbeAddr** (not address-as-sentinel); **lastTaskWasGapProbe**: OnResult(Probe) does not update state when true; gap probe is observation-only.
- For **boundary**: seed validation — full seed inside [StartAddress, EndAddress] (else phase=Done). At left/right expand, **clamp when possible**; if clamping would yield Count 0, emit no task and transition to next phase (set leftLow/leftHigh or rightLow/rightHigh as in 7.2/7.5, then LeftBinary or RightBinary). When entering a binary phase with no search space (leftLow ≥ leftHigh or rightLow > rightHigh), emit no task and transition immediately (RightExpand or Done). Left/right binary invariants and termination as specified.
- For **sunspec**: two-phase state machine (detectBase → walkModels → done). Parse candidate bases from config or use library defaults. If known base set, skip detection. Detection: emit `{base, 2}`; check marker bytes. Walk: emit `{currentAddr, 2}` for header; parse (id, length); then read body in chunks of min(125, remaining) (`readingBody` sub-phase); advance by 2+length; stop on end model (`0xFFFF`, 0), length 0, overflow, maxModels, maxSpan, read failure, or body read failure. Uses exported library constants (`SunSpecMarkerReg0/1`, `SunSpecEndModelID/Length`, `sunspec.DefaultBaseAddresses`).

All addresses and counts are 16-bit unsigned; clamp to [0, 65535] and to the configured start/end where specified.
